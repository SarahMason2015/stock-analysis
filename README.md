<h1>Green Stocks Analysis</h1>
<p><h2>Overview of Project</h2></p>
<p>Steve, a doting and loyal son, has come to us for help. He is a newly minted financial industry expert, and his parents would like to be his first clients. Steve’s parents are passionate about green energy and are looking to invest. With many forms of green energy to invest in, they went with their hearts, they chose the ticker symbol that spoke to them, “DQ.” Steve’s parents met at DQ many years ago, they were a winning couple, so this must be kismet! Or is it? </p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>As a financial industry expert Steve wants to give the best possible advice to allow his clients to make the most of their money. Since his parents are his first clients, this is more important than ever. He must help guide them into making the best possible decision. Steve has been kind enough to gather information from several green energy stock from 2017 and 2018 in a spread sheet. I have made a simple, and interactive spreadsheet to help put into visualization information for Steve to share with his parents it hopes that the results will sway them to diversify their stocks. </p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>In 2017 stocks for green energy were outstanding. All but one we’re up, four of the stocks, including “DQ” were up triple digits. The stocks with positive return over the year are labeled in green, and the single one that lost is in red. This seems like good news; a big return is exactly what you want to see but can “DQ” and the other companies keep pace? </p>
<p>As you can see, the pace was not kept. As a matter of fact, in 2018 the stocks lost over 60% of the growth the made in 2017. Along side “DQ” other stocks suffered, so they weren’t the only one who lost. </p>
<p>Although there were many stocks that declined in value, there is still hope. Of the four stocks that increased by triple digits in 2017 one continued to grow. </p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Dealing in the stock market is risky business, you must do your research, or you could end up losing a lot of money. Just as if you were to pick a team to win because they had pretty uniforms, it is just as much, if not more of a gamble when you’re investing.  Our “DQ” love birds picking DAQO because of their name, although romantic, is not wise. They need to listen to their son, look at the data, and diversify. </p>
<p>While this data is good, it’s not great. Two years is not a lot to go on, especially in a changing environment. However, this is what they have. If I were to invest my money, I would put the data for both years side by side. We know most everyone drastically went up in 2017, and most everyone fell in 2018. Who fell the least, or not at all? My top three are “RUN,” “ENPH,” and “VSLR.” For nostalgic reasons, “DQ” can slide in at #4, but I wouldn’t too much into them. </p>
<h3>Refactoring Code</h3>
Refactoring code is like investing. You want to get the most out of what you have. Code: How fast can we get the data? Investing: How fast can the market make your money grow? Luckily, code is a bit easier and less of a gamble. The idea of refactoring code is not to change the outcome, it just to simply make it better and more efficient. Is it absolutely necessary to change the code once you have the end product down, no. But, if you want to run this code through lager pools of data, it might be beneficial to tweak it to make it run a little faster or potentially be more comprehensive for future endeavors. Luckily, with the original code, you know you have something that works, that solid starting point. </p>
<h3>Refactoring VBA</h3>
<p>Refactoring the VBA code wasn’t completely necessary. We had the results we were looking for, and it help to determine what stocks fared well in 2017 and 2018. The data set was small, and the information was presented quickly in both versions of code. Below, you will see the elapsed time for both 2017 and 2017 within the refactored code. The time elapsed for the previous code was almost exact. </p>

In the future if Steve would like to analyze a larger number of stocks, or even the entire stock market, that’s when Steve will see the difference in how long it takes to pull the data. For now, we can be thankful Steve wanted to start with a small pool of data.
